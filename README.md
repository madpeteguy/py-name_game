# Game of Names in Python
The Game of Names was created to help new parents in choosing the name for their unborn.
It's my first time with Python.

# The story
Have you ever had a problem with choosing a unborn's name?

I thought it was a simple matter: the mother chooses. :sunglasses:  
But the reality is not so simple.  
Firstly, she was not determined either, and secondly, it supposed to be our joint decision.

After a few days of thinking up, there was no effect. :dizzy_face:  
Then I came up with the idea that Python could help us.

Case was simple:
* From a given set of names, draw two and choose the one you like the most.
* Score choosen name by transfering some points from one that you didn't like.
* Increase the chance for more-liked names to showup.
* Show top 10 names.

I never programmed in Python, but it took few hours to write this simple script.  
We were so undecided that we started with a full list of 738 names.  
After three evenings of having fun (with eliminating about 700 names we didn't like at all) we have two names left.

At the end our newborn made the final in cry and smile game. :smirk:

# How to play
Place all names you like in `names.json`.  
Run `name_game.py` and follow instructions.  
Progress will be saved in `db.json`.
